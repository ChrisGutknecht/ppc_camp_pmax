# Welcome to this PPC Camp Repository for PMAX campaign structuring

This repository contains Javascript and SQL code to optimize your PMAX shopping campaigns. The code is related a conference session held at PPC Camp Rosenheim in October 2023.

The slides can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherGutknecht/

For the following two shopping optimization problems, two code solutions were presented:
1. Excluding villain products by considering the SKU price and expecting the next click to convert. See here for the Google Ads Script: https://gist.github.com/ChrisGutknecht/51b76e191cf896405aa8e9086cb0c41f
2. Quantifying the current size selection as a value between 0 and 1 by referring to a historic best selection. See the subdirectory for the SQL code and instructions
